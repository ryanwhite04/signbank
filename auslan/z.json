Financial support has recently become available from the AMP Tomorrow Fund (grant to Trevor Johnston), the Ian Potter Foundation (grant to Adam Schembri) and the Australian Research Council (grant to Trevor Johnston and Adam Schembri) that means we are now able to address these problems. For example, the videos in Auslan Signbank are being refilmed and replaced between now and December 2015. The Auslan Signbank site (a dictionary of Auslan) is also being expanded to include the video clips and basic mutli-media annotation files from the Auslan Corpus (a collection of videos showing deaf Australians using Auslan as they tell stories and have natural informal conversations). We hope the new site will be completed by January 2016."
