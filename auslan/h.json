You show the surfaces of the roof by placing your flat or spread hands where you imagine the roof to be relative to yourself. Your hands represent the roof itself, or you move them as if you were moving your hand over the surface of the imaginary roof. You cannot use just any handshape in Auslan. It needs to be a flat or spread handshape, and you need to hold it with the palms facing down."
