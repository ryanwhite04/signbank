However, repetition alone does not make the sign a noun as it could also still be used as a verb to mean \"to earn again and again/over time\" or \"to earn habitually\" (e.g., \"He is earning more than his father.\") Usually it is the other signs in the sentence and the context in which it is made that tells you if a sign is to be understood as a noun or a verb."
